1. Assuming we have Network based sequential databases (system network databases) for N versions.
2. Use SNERMiningMinStab.java with minSup-minConf-minStab: output = Collection of NRs + SNER (NSR) + NetworkRuleCount for each state
3. Use SummaryNetworkStableRules.java for NSR (in entityName format) and its count
4. Use MergeUniqueNetworkEvolutionRules.java for NER
5. Use SummaryEvolutionNetworkRules.java for NER (in entityName format) and its count

Step 4 and 5 can be in any sequence
